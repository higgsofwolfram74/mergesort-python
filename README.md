# mergesort-python
An implementation of the mergesort algorithm using Python

Going through a class involving divide-and-conquer algorithms, there was a discernable lack of what I would consider a good "pythonic" mergesort algorithm. This project merely utilizes some python builtins to make it look more clean and efficient and I even implemented the functionality to sort sentences for good fun. I might in the future actually add a more convenient way of providing input for this but I wouldn't consider it likely as I am happy with where this algorithm is for the time being.
